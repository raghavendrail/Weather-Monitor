Features Implemented
The system continuously calls the OpenWeatherMap API at a configurable interval (e.g., every 5 minutes) to retrieve real-time weather data for major metros in India, including:
Delhi
Mumbai
Chennai
Bangalore
Kolkata
Hyderabad
For each received weather update, the system converts temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius. This conversion can also accommodate user preferences for temperature units.
